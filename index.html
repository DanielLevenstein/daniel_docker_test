<h1>My First Webpage!
</h1>
<p>This is my first webpage created using the nginx docker image. This file is located at /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html on the web_server docker image</p>
<p> In my first version of this website I manually modified the index.html file by logging onto the server. Next I would like to create a docker image that pulls from the nginx:1.27.0 docker image and copy my new index.html file onto that web server directly. </p>
<p> To do this I will create a Dockerfile locally and as the first command in the docker file I will copy my new HTML page onto the server. </p>
<P> Modifications to this file require you to rebuild the docker image, which may require first deleting the existing running image. </P>
